## SCRUM framework

> "SCRUM is a team-based framework to develop complex systems and products"

Product backlog -> Sprint planning -> Sprint backlog -> Daily scrum -> Review -> Increment

### Three pillars of SCRUM

#### Transparency

Everyone presents the facts as is, and collectively collaborates for the common organisational objective. Nobody has a hidden agenda.

#### Inspection

Not done by an inspector but by everyone on the scrum team, the inspection can be done for the product, processes, people aspects, practices.

#### Adaptation

Adaptation is about continuous improvement, to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone should reflect on how to improve.

### The scrum team

- Co-located
- Engaged with customers
- Self-organising
- Accountable and empowered 
- Cross-functional

### SCRUM roles

**Product owner**

- Key stakeholder, representative, communicates with both the team and other stakeholders

**Scrum master**

- Essentially the project manager, makes sure the team is following the values of Scrum.

**Dev team**

- Effectively 3-9 people
- Everyone is accountable for the team's productivity 

### SCRUM workshop

- **User stories** 

  - e.g. As a *Type of user*, I want *goal*, so that I can *reason*
  - They do not include all the detail - just a pointer to the actual requirement
  - Needs to be understandable by normal people
  - Needs to follow the format of As a... I want.... So that..
  - Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable

### Acceptance criteria

1. **Given** *I am on the homepage*

2. **When** *I click the link* 

3. **Then** *I should see the link click confirmation*

   

### BDD - Behaviour-Driven development

BDD is a software development process which puts behaviour first.

> A behaviour is how a feature operates within a well-defined scenario of inputs, actions and outcomes.

Allows for the non-technical members of the project team to have a better understanding of how the product will function.

1. Product owner talks about what they need
2. They present requirements to make sure everyone is on the same page
3. Requirements are created, and acceptance criteria are written as gherkin features
4. Product is developed based on requirements
5. Gherkin features are used to create tests for the product

**Imperative vs Declarative syntax**

- Step by step
- More detail

Declarative style

- Less detail
- Understood by wider stakeholders
