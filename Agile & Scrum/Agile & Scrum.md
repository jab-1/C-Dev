## Scrum framework

> "SCRUM is a team-based framework to develop complex systems and products"

Product backlog -> Sprint planning -> Sprint backlog -> Daily scrum -> Review -> Increment

### Three pillars of scrum

#### Transparency

Everyone presents the facts as is, and collectively collaborates for the common organisational objectiVE. Nobody has a hidden agenda.

#### Inspection

Not done by an inspector but by everyone on the scrum team, the inspection can be done for the product, processes, people aspects, practices 

#### Adaptation

Adaptation is about continuous improvement, to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone should reflect on how to improve.

### The scrum team

- Co-located
- Engaged with customers

- Accountable and empowered 
- Cross-functional

### SCRUM roles

**Dev team**
